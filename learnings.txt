1) See node knows all ejs files are in views folder....so specifying /views is not necessary in the render statement.
   But inside the views folder if other folders are present then u have to give ./partials/header.
   ./ means in the current directory that u are in i.e views , go to partials folder and then render header

 2) Use <%- include ("./partials/header") %> this syntax for including.
